            <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Problem</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;">According to the British Broadcasting Corporation's Loneliness Experiment, younger people (ages 16-24) are found to have the highest rate of loneliness among all age groups (Hammond). Regardless of demographics and age, loneliness can lead to negative physical and psychological effects, such as increased stress and a weakened immune and cardiovascular system (Hawkley).</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p style="text-align:center;">There never seems to be enough hours throughout the day. Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert, we’ll all eventually want to hang out and catch up with old friends or step outside and meet new people. Finding the time and making it happen, however, is much harder than it seems. Not everyone is in the same area — especially those that are away from home for school —  and everyone has different schedules, interests, and needs. Making everything work for a day or just a couple of hours could take weeks of planning. There may be solutions for this problem in the professional workplace, but a more personal one is needed.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Solution</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Sharing one’s calendar, texting back and forth, and having spontaneous trips are simple solutions. ScheduleMe, however, will be able to automate finding the best suitable time for everyone! Users will be able to share their “free-time” amongst friends; they’ll be able to easily see when their friends are all available. With a simple click of a button, a recommended time that fits everyone’s schedule will appear. Friend groups will no longer have to repeatedly ask and keep track of when everyone is free. Once a time is chosen, the event will then be added to everyone’s respective Google Calendar. Scheduling will be at the tip of everyone’s fingers!</p>

                            Hello! I'm Ally. I enjoy hanging out with friends, numerous forms of art, various music genres, learning, and helping people in need! My college is 400 miles away from home so conflicts hometown friends occur, when I'm back for breaks. Being a young adult, this is probably the best time to make and maintain lifelong connections. A way to more easily deal with scheduling conflicts, however, is needed.

                            Hello! I'm Brandon and I love to play video games, listen to music, and explore. Towards the end of high school, I started to stream the games I play which took away a lot of time from spending time with my closest friends. Trying to manage my streaming schedule, school schedule, and social schedule became incredibly hard. Simply put, I did not know how to separate my streaming life from my social life.

                            Hello! I'm Chrystal. I enjoy playing video games, discovering and eating new delicious food, and going out with friends. However, ever since graduating from high school, I have found it increasingly difficult to make plans with friends, since they’re either from different cities, have other obligations to attend to, or difficult to get a hold on. Having a way to simplify the process would help with maintaining friendships and managing my schedule.

                            Hello! I'm Howard and my hobbies include playing ball sports, video games, and hanging out with friends. As an international student that’s busy during school and traveling during breaks and holidays, it is hard for me to meet up with friends who are also on the move and/or have different school and work schedule. The usual time frame to meet a returning or visiting friend might only be a few days to a week.

My household moves quite often for their jobs so most of my close friends are out of town. I set schedules on a regular basis for my friends simply because the amount of time needed to even go to them is cumbersome. A method to show my friends when I have enough time to even make it worth going would be convenient.
